# Keep config if user wants, but typically settings.json can be local. 
# User saw warning about c_cpp_properties.json, maybe ignore that one specifically or just allow .vscode generally. 
# Plan said ".vscode/ (optional)". Let's ignore complete .vscode folder but keep tasks/launch if they exist (good practice), 
# but simply:
.vscode/

# Build directories
build/
bin/
debug/
release/
